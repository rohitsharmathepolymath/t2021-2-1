# Project Name

## Overview

This project is written in **C++**, leveraging its powerful features like object-oriented programming, memory management, and high-performance computation.

## Problem

- **Problem 1**: Create a small calculator which performs operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division using class.
- **Problem 2**: With a single integer as the input, generate the following until a = x [series of numbers as shown in below examples]
  Output: (examples)

        1) input a = 1, then output : 1

        2) input a = 2, then output : 1, 3

        3) input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5

        4) input a = 4, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7

- **Problem 3**: With a single integer as the input, generate the following until a = x [series of numbers as shown in below examples]
  Output: (examples) 1) input a = 1, then output : 1

        2) input a = 2, then output : 1

        3) input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5

        4) input a = 4, then output : 1, 3, 5

        5) input a = 5, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

- **Problem 4**:Get the total count of number listed in the dictionary which is multiple of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

        (examples)

        input: [1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]

        Output:

            {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this C++ project, ensure the following are installed:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- A development environment or terminal

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   In bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohitsharmathepolymath/t2021-2-1.git

   ```

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   In bash

   > cd t2021-2-1

3. Compile the code:
